    <p>
  Welcome to our workshop on measurement, hypothesis testing, experimentation, and causal inference. These topics are often taught in isolation and with different terminologies, even though they address tightly connected questions. The goal of this workshop is to integrate these areas within a single conceptual framework and a shared lexicon for discussing how constructs are measured, experiments are implemented, and causal claims are justified. Developing this common language helps link theory, research design, statistical analysis, and interpretation into a coherent workflow.
</p>

<p>
  Participants will learn that credible causal inference ultimately depends on the assumptions underlying hypothesis testing, and that these assumptions themselves are grounded in measurement. Throughout the workshop, we trace how decisions at the measurement stage shape experimental design and, in turn, the strength and scope of causal conclusions.
</p>

<p>
  The first module introduces core principles of psychometrics and latent-variable thinking, applied directly to typical psychology-style survey-based experiments and to empirical modeling approaches commonly applied to field experiments and secondary data. Participants learn how constructs are inferred from imperfect measures and how reliability and validity depend jointly on both the construct and the measurement instrument.
</p>

<p>
  The second module focuses on hypothesis testing and experimentation. Building on Module 1, both outcomes and treatments are treated as measured and potentially noisy variables rather than as perfectly implemented inputs. We examine how factors such as treatment strength, noncompliance, and construct validity affect inference. In addition to standard psychology-style lab experiments and typical A/B-test field experiments, the module introduces more advanced experimental designs.
</p>

<p>
  The third module covers modern frameworks for causal inference, including counterfactual (Rubin) and graphical (Pearl) approaches, as well as applied tools such as difference-in-differences and related designs aimed to link empirical data with causal-inference frameworks. Emphasis is placed on how these methods depend not only on identification assumptions but also on the quality of the measurements and experimental implementations developed in earlier modules.
</p>

<p>
  Across all topics, paired experimental and secondary-data examples illustrate how the same principles apply in both controlled and applied research contexts. The workshop highlights common pitfalls that arise when measurement, design, and causal analysis are treated separately rather than as integrated components of a single inferential process.
</p>

<p>
  By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to articulate the key explicit and implicit assumptions behind published empirical findings and evaluate how these assumptions affect interpretation and generalization of results.
