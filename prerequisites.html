    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

    <p>
      The workshop assumes a shared baseline across participants coming from experimental and econometric modeling traditions. The list below combines the essentials from both worlds. You do not need advanced mastery of any item, but you should have a basic understanding of the concepts to get the most out of the workshop.
    </p>

<h4>Foundations from experimental psychology and related fields</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Variables and causal language:
    independent, dependent, and control variables; intuitive understanding of confounds and omitted variables.</li>
  
  <li>Experimental designs:
    between-subject and within-subject designs, simple factorial designs (e.g., 2×2),
    and the meanings of main effects and interaction effects.</li>

  <li>Conceptual grounding in experimental logic:
    familiarity with the rationale of randomized experiments, manipulation checks, and awareness of threats such as
    demand effects, experimenter expectations, and lack of blinding.</li>

  <li>Measurement fundamentals:
    familiarity with latent constructs, multi-item scales, and the idea that measures differ in reliability and validity.</li>

  <li>Validity terminology:
    internal and external validity, face validity,
    convergent and discriminant validity, and ecological validity (basic recognition of what each refers to,
    without needing formal definitions).</li>

  <li>Statistical basics commonly used in experiments:
    null and alternative hypotheses, p values and statistical significance, descriptive statistics,
    correlations as measures of association, and a high-level understanding that regression is
    the general framework underlying ANOVA and many experimental analyses.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Foundations from statistical and econometric modeling</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Regression literacy:
    experience fitting or interpreting multiple linear regression models,
    including reading coefficients and standard errors and understanding
    how adding covariates relates to confounding and omitted variable bias.</li>

  <li>Basic statistical concepts:
    i.i.d. assumptions, awareness of heteroskedasticity and dependence,
    and recognition that significance testing with p values reflects assumptions
    about sampling variability rather than causal validity.</li>

  <li>Multilevel and clustered data:
    basic conceptual understanding (not necessarily experience modeling) of nested or grouped data structures
    (for example repeated measures within individuals, students within classrooms,
    or transactions within customers) and why dependence violates simple independence assumptions.A familiarity with terms like “clustering,” “random effects,” or “mixed models” at a descriptive level is sufficient.</li>

  <li>Associational measures:
    correlations, partial correlations, and regression adjustment
    understood as tools for conditioning on covariates.</li>

  <li>Latent-variable intuition:
    basic familiarity with factor analysis or dimensionality-reduction ideas as ways to infer latent structure
    from observed variables (no estimation details required).</li>
 
  <li>Conceptual grounding in experimental logic:
    familiarity with the rationale of field experiments,
    the meaning generalizability and ``assumed at random'',
    and the idea of treatment versus control even when working with naturally occurring or observational data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Participants who are comfortable with these two sets of foundations will be well prepared to engage with the workshop’s central goal: integrating measurement theory, experimental design, and modern causal inference into a single coherent framework for evaluating evidence and drawing defensible conclusions from both experimental and observational research. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
