    <h3>Prerequisites</h3>

    <p>
      The workshop assumes a shared baseline across participants coming from experimental and modeling traditions. The list below combines the essentials from both worlds. You do not need advanced mastery of any item, but you should have seen each idea at least once in your training to get the most out of Modules 1, 2, and 3.
    </p>

    <h4>Variables, designs, and validity</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Independent, dependent, and control variables, and the basic idea of a confound or omitted variable that could explain an observed effect.</li>
      <li>Simple experimental designs:
        between-subject, within-subject, and a basic 2×2 factorial design, including what is meant by a main effect and an interaction.
      </li>
      <li>Recognition of core validity labels:
        internal, external, content, predictive, concurrent, convergent, discriminant, and ecological validity, even if the boundaries between them are not yet fully crisp.</li>
      <li>Familiarity with the idea that many constructs (e.g., attitudes, happiness, satisfaction) are latent and assessed with items or indicators that may have imperfect reliability and validity.</li>
      <li>Very basic intuition for factor analysis as a way to summarize or infer latent dimensions from observed items, without needing to know estimation details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Statistical literacy</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Null and alternative hypotheses and the concept of significance testing with p values.</li>
      <li>Descriptive distributional concepts:
        heterogeneity, normality, skewness, kurtosis.
      </li>
      <li>Correlations as a measure of association, with at least a rough understanding of partial and semi-partial correlations as “controlling for” another variable.</li>
      <li>Comfort reading or estimating a basic linear regression where an outcome is modeled as a function of one or more predictors
        (for example, Y regressed on X and controls), including interpreting coefficients and standard errors at a high level.</li>
      <li>Awareness that “correlation is not causation” and that omitted variables and selection processes can create spurious relationships.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Foundations from psychological experiments</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Intuitive understanding of random assignment in experiments and why it helps with causal claims.</li>
      <li>Exposure to common experimental threats:
        demand effects, experimenter effects, and basic ideas of blinding and counterbalancing, even if you have not formally labeled them as exclusion-restriction violations.
      </li>
      <li>Basic sense of what a manipulation check is and why researchers use them.</li>
      <li>Conceptual familiarity with mediation and moderation diagrams (X → M → Y; X interacting with W) from standard social science applications.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Foundations from statistical / econometric modeling</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Experience fitting or interpreting multiple regression models in which you add covariates to reduce confounding or improve precision.</li>
      <li>Awareness of the i.i.d. assumption and the idea that clustering or repeated measures break simple independence assumptions.</li>
      <li>Conceptual understanding that many identification strategies in observational work rely on conditional independence or sequential ignorability: once we condition on certain variables, comparisons are treated as if they were randomized.</li>
      <li>Basic familiarity with the language of potential outcomes (for example, “what would have happened under control”) or with DAG-style reasoning, even if you have not worked through the formal frameworks of Rubin or Pearl.</li>
      <li>Intuitive sense of measurement error and proxies:
        that noisy or biased measures of constructs can attenuate or distort regression estimates in both experimental and observational settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Participants who are comfortable with this shared set of concepts will be able to focus on the workshop’s main goals:
      deepening their understanding of reliability and validity, making experimental assumptions explicit, and using modern causal frameworks to connect measurement, design, and identification into a single, coherent workflow.
