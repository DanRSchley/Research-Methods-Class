    <h3>Syllabus overview</h3>

    <p>
      The workshop has three linked modules. Each one uses examples from lab and field experiments and from secondary or observational data to show how measurement, design, and causal inference fit together into a single pipeline.
    </p>

    <h4>Module 1 – Introduction to Measurement</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>State of measurement practice in psychology and related experimental behavioral-science doamins; why measurement is often the weakest link.</li>
      <li>What measurement is in a formal sense and why most constructs of interest are latent rather than directly observed.</li>
      <li>Core properties of good measurement:
        reliability (test–retest, inter-rater, internal consistency) and validity
        (content, concurrent, predictive, convergent, discriminant, ecological).
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The difference between understanding the definitions of "validity" and what empirical and conceptual features actually evidence validity.
        </ul>
      <li>Classical Test Theory and the X = T + E decomposition.</li>
      <li>Random versus systematic measurement error, heterogeneous error, and how both influence estimates in experiments and in secondary data.</li>
      <li>“Unicorn measurement” and “unicorn studies”: when scales and designs look good psychometrically but are really tapping lay theories or composites of several constructs.</li>
      <li>Convergent and discriminant validity revisited, including examples that show how validity assumptions interact with theory evaluation.</li>
      <li>Measurement invariance across groups or occasions (item shift and construct shift) and what it means for comparing means and effects.</li>
      <li>Latent classes, mixture structure, and outlier detection:
        basic clustering and density-based approaches, and how Simpson’s paradox appears when within-cluster and between-cluster patterns diverge.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Module 2 – Experimentation and Hypothesis Testing</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>The exclusion restriction as the central assumption in experiments:
        distinguishing constant error from systematic extraneous variables.
      </li>
      <li>Demand characteristics, experimenter expectations, and sparse information; how blinding, double-blinding, and careful interface design help.</li>
      <li>Order effects and counterbalancing in within-subject designs; when counterbalancing is and is not sufficient.</li>
      <li>History and cohort effects in both experiments and secondary data; links to heterogeneous treatment effects and conditional average treatment effects.</li>
      <li>A systematic workflow for thinking about extraneous/counfounding variables.</li>
      <li>Measurement invariance as a tacit assumption in experiments.</li>
      <li>Experimental and research designs:
        fully randomized designs, between versus within, factorial and Latin-square designs, orthogonal designs, and large metastudy designs.
      </li>
      <li>Null hypothesis significance testing:
        null and alternative hypotheses, p values, Type I and II errors, effect sizes, and power, with an emphasis on interpretation rather than mechanical rules.</li>
      <li>Outliers, principled exclusion, and the consequences of researcher degrees of freedom and p-hacking for inference and replicability.</li>
      <li>Censored and survival-type outcomes and when survival analysis tools become relevant even for behavioral data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Module 3 – Causal Inference</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>Defining "casuality" conceptually </li>
      <li>Causal chains, order of links, and attenuation of effects along casual chains.</li>
      <li>Data-generating mechanisms and why causal inference is about modeling these mechanisms, not just fitting data.</li>
      <li>Reichenbach’s common cause principle.</li>
      <li>Conditional independence, collider structures, and collider bias.</li>
      <li>Rubin’s potential outcomes framework:
        potential outcomes, SUTVA, ignorability, and selection processes such as undercoverage, self-selection, survivorship, attrition, and exclusion.</li>
      <li>Pearl’s graphical framework:
        DAGs, backdoor paths and backdoor criteria, front-door identification.</li>
      <li>Design-based estimation</li>
          <ul>
        <li> When groups become imbalanced: </li>
             <li>regression adjustment, inverse probability weighting, covariate matching, and propensity score matching, and doubly robust estimation.</li>
                    <li> Introductions and what to look out for in these approaches.</li>
      <li> Assuming groups are balanced, generating the counterfactual for casual inference</li>
       <li> Difference-in-differences, synthetic controls, and regression discontinuity</li>
        <li> Introductions and what to look out for in these approaches.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>What is “Statistical mediation” and how the PROCESS macro can generate huge Type-I error.</li>
    </ul>
